            <p>Objectives: Educational escape rooms are a novel type of learning activity that has the potential to improve studentsâ€™ hard and soft skills while boosting engagement and motivation. However, there are pedagogical and technological barriers hindering their use and adoption. The IGLUE project aims to empower universities to create and conduct pedagogically sound educational escape rooms and promote the widespread use and adoption of such innovative learning activities across Europe.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="project-implementation">
            <p>Implementation: First, a methodology for designing pedagogically sound educational escape rooms will be defined. Then, a virtual platform for creating, conducting, and sharing educational escape rooms will be developed and deployed at each participating organization, forming a European network. Teachers will be trained on how to use the methodology and the platform and will execute pilot escape rooms to validate the developed solution. Several dissemination and exploitation activities will also be carried out..</p>

	<section id="project-results">
            <p>Expected results: </p>
		<p>* A methodology and a virtual platform to facilitate teachers the design, build, and execution of educational escape rooms. </p>
		<p>* An open and decentralized European network of educational escape rooms.</p>
		<p>* 6 teacher training courses: 3 expert-led courses and 3 MOOC courses. </p>
		<p>* 125 teachers trained in the use of the methodology and the platform.</p>
		<p>* 30 educational escape rooms involving 1500 students. </p>
		<p>* 8 multiplier events that extend the project's impact to a broader audience, including K-12 schools. </p>
