            <h2>About the IGLUE Project</h2>
			<p></p>
            <p>The IGLUE project aims to empower universities to create and conduct pedagogically sound educational escape rooms, promoting widespread adoption across Europe to enhance teaching practices.</p>
            <p>The project promotes educational escape rooms to enhance student performance and engagement. Activities are aimed at overcoming barriers to adoption by providing teachers with the necessary training and tools to effectively design, build, and conduct these learning activities.</p>
			<br>
            <p>Objective of the IGLUE project are to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Define a methodology for designing educational escape rooms.</li>
                <li>Provide teachers with digital tools and training to create these activities.</li>
                <li>Implement and assess educational escape rooms across European universities using this methodology.</li>
                <li>Establish a European network for creating, sharing, and executing educational escape rooms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
	    <p> The project will have an initial pedagogical design phase in which a methodology for designing effective instructional interventions based on educational escape rooms will be defined. On this basis, a virtual platform for creating, conducting, and sharing educational escape rooms will be developed and deployed at each participating institution forming a European network of escape rooms. This network will be decentralized and open to new institutions. Teachers will be trained in the use of the methodology and the platform developed in the project, increasing the capacity and readiness of institutions to manage an effective shift towards effective digital education. A series of educational escape rooms will be created, conducted, and evaluated within the scope of the project, which will be used not only to teach course-specific topics to students, but also to develop soft skills. These escape rooms will be used as pilot experiences to validate the proposed methodology and the developed technological solution in a wide range of higher education settings, including face-to-face and distance settings, as well as engineering and humanities courses. Lastly, multiplier events will be held in order to extend the reach and impact of the project to a wider audience involving educational institutions across all levels of education.</p>
            
            <p>Project is developed through several key phases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Work package 1:</strong> Project Management</li>
                <li><strong>Work package 2:</strong> Pedagogical foundation for escape room design</li>
                <li><strong>Work package 3:</strong> Development of digital tools</li>
                <li><strong>Work package 4:</strong> Teacher training and escape room implementation</li>
                <li><strong>Work package 5:</strong> Dissemination and exploitation</li>
            </ul>
	    <p>In summary, the IGLUE project will facilitate the design, creation, execution, and sharing of pedagogically sound educational escape rooms, promoting thereby the widespread adoption of this novel game-based learning approach. Furthermore, this project will contribute to a better understanding of the benefits and challenges of employing educational escape rooms in
higher education.:</p>
